# Problem Definition
## Problem Title: Employee Bonus Management System

## A company needs a system to calculate bonuses for employees. The system should:

- Store multiple employee salary values for processing (Collections)

- Keep employee information together (Records)

- Skip employees with problems like zero salary (GOTO)

- The system will calculate bonuses based on employee performance ratings and salaries.

# Objectives
- Create tables for employees and bonus records

- Use PL/SQL with Collections, Records, and GOTO

- Calculate bonuses for good performers

- Handle errors when data is bad

- Show results clearly
